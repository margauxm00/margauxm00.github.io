<h4> Favorite CMSC subject so far and why </h4>
<p> CMSC 100. I enjoy learning about the back-end and front-end side of designing a web application. It's fascinating to be able to comprehensively learn about how a web app is designed.</p>

<h4> Favorite GE so far and why </h4>
<p> SOSC3. My prof was Panginoon. </p>

<h4> Favorite PL and why </h4>
<p> Javascript. It is by far the hardest PL that I had to learn but I recognize its strengths as a PL. It is challenging to learn because it is much more complex but it can be really powerful.</p>

<h4> How is your Holiday/Semestral Break? </h4>
<p> I had a restful one. I was burned out last semester so I was definitely a much  awaited break. </p>
